## Introduction

A markbook for documenting the fedapp.

The book is avaliable at http://dku-vcm-2630.vm.duke.edu:8006/ (DKU wifi needed).

## Update

The content of the book is at ./fedapp/src.

- To add a new page, you need to create a new markdown file and include that in the **SUMMARY.md.**
- To modify an exsiting page, you directly change the corresponding markdown file.

To update the book, you simply push the change to git. After about 10 seconds, you should see the update on http://dku-vcm-2630.vm.duke.edu:8006/ .
